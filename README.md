Wait a minute...

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, use the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open **[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** with your browser to see the result.

Cookbook also utilizes a comprehensive component library visualized through Storybook. To browse the available UI components and their variations, run:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

This command fires up the Storybook environment at **[localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)**, where you can view and test components in isolation, ensuring a consistent look and feel throughout the app.
